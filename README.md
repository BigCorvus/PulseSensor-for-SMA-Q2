# PulseSensor-for-SMA-Q2
The Pulse Sensor from https://pulsesensor.com re-designed to be made on a tiny flex PCB to replace the HR sensor of  the SMA-Q2 watch.
Have the board manufactured via the OSHpark flex sevice. This way the board remains as low profile as possible. As a light shield to avoid light hitting the ADPS-9008 from the sides I used a piece of the black component tape the SC70-5 style opamp came packaged in. Just had to cafully cut out the bottom of the tiny tray et voila! Note: the board version depicted on the photos is an older revision where I placed the wire pads wrong.
